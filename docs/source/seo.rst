SEO strategy and page hierarchy
===============================


Pages
-----

This is the pattern of pages we will publish during the midterm elections.



- ``/2018/``
- ``/2018/senate/``
- ``/2018/house/``
- ``/2018/texas/``
- ``/2018/texas/schedule/``
- ``/2018/senate/texas/``
- ``/2018/house/texas/``
- ``/2018/texas/governor/``
- ``/2018/texas/primary/``
- ``/2018/texas/primary/runoff/``
- ``/2018/senate/texas/primary/``
- ``/2018/house/texas/primary/``
- ``/2018/senate/texas/primary/runoff/``
- ``/2018/house/texas/primary/runoff/``


.. note::

  At the state level, we double publish results on pages optimized for search for specific races -- e.g., "Texas senate races" at ``/senate/texas/`` -- *and* comprehensive state results -- e.g., "Texas election results" at ``/texas/``.

General election results pages SEO and link equity strategy
-----------------------------------------------------------

The earlier we publish pages with content to the eventual home of general election results, the more link equity and the better SEO we'll have.

In order to get general election pages published with content we publish whatever we know about the midterms when we know it. We use election calendars as placeholder content before we know about candidates or have results.

For **national pages** like ``/2018/`` and ``/2018/senate/`` will have 2 phases of content:

1. As early as possible, we will publish the national calendar to the page.
2. Before polls close for the general, we will publish results to the page.

For **state pages** like ``/2018/california/``, we will have 5 different phases of content:

1. As early as possible, we will publish the California state calendar to the page.

2. As of the first AP test for state primaries, we will publish zeroed results tables to the page.

3. When polls close in the primary, we will publish primary results to the page.

4. As of the first AP test for the general election, we will publish zeroed results tables to the page.

5. Before polls close for the general, we will publish results to the page.


.. note::

  As a page progresses through the cycle, we will retire different phases of content to archival pages, for example:

  - ``/2018/california/schedule/``
  - ``/2018/california/primary/``


Internal navigation hierarchy
-----------------------------

We will emphasize these paths through pages:

- ``/2018/`` >>> ``/2018/texas/`` >>> ``/2018/{senate|house}/texas/``
- ``/2018/`` >>> ``/2018/senate/`` >>> ``/2018/senate/texas/``
- ``/2018/`` >>> ``/2018/house/`` >>> ``/2018/house/texas/``

Homepage, referral and social link strategy
-------------------------------------------

Homepage should link to national and state-level pages:

- ``/2018/``
- ``/2018/senate/``
- ``/2018/house/``
- ``/2018/texas/``

Social and referral links should point to state senate and house breakdown pages whenever referencing the results for any specific race:

- ``/2018/senate/texas/``
- ``/2018/house/texas/``
- ``/2018/texas/governor/``
